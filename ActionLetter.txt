Subject: Termination of Lease

Your rent was due on (int date). The amount due was $(float rentDue).
Because the payment is late, a late fee of $(float lateFee) has been added.
As no attempt to pay was made by (int secondLateDate), we will be terminating
your rental agreement. You must move out within one week.

Regards,

(String companyName)
