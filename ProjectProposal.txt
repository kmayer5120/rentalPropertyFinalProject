**Description of the project**

We will be working with a local real estate investor company in order to develop a server-based property management system. This
company works with home, apartment complex, and AirBnB rentals. This company would like to be able to store all tenant and rental
information within a database that can be easily modified using a GUI (graphical user interface). This program should also provide
a method for billing and late payment handling.

**Business Objectives (under your assumptions) and Requirements**
  - To be able to assign tenants to rental properties
  - To be able to add, remove and edit both tenants and rental properties
  - To be able to query tenant and rental property data
  - For billing statements to be generated monthly for tenants (button to click to indicate PAID)
  - Late payment notices to be generated after X days of non-payment

**Analysis and Approaches**
