This program gives property managers the ability to manage a database of
rental properties and tenants through the use of a user friendly graphical
user interface. This application allows for simple manipulation of a database
by way of creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. If a tenant is
late on a payment action letters for each stage of tenant payment deliquency 
is automatically filled out with the information corresponding to that tenant. 
This action letter is saved to a file with the tenant's first name, last name,
and the property ID. This functionality makes for a fast and simple way to 
notify tenants that are past due on their rent payments.
