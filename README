Rental Database Management System
---------------------------------

Please refer to the documents in InstallationInstructions if there are any problems
installing. In that directory are the main installer to clone the software
repository hosted on Github and some instructions to install and troubleshoot
the database. 


------------Installation
For either of the install.sh and run.sh/runServer.sh/runClient.sh to be executed be 
sure to run the following commands: 

    chmod 774 install.sh && chmod 774 run.sh
    chmod 774 runClient.sh && chmod 775 runServer.sh

To install run the following command from the InstallationInstructions
directory:
      
      ./install.sh
    
NOTE: It is important to compile the Java source code before running it!
      In the directory RentalPropertyManagementSystem/src issue the
      following command. This compiles all Java source code in the
      directory.

       javac *.java


------------Running The Application
The application can be ran in three different configurations. 
    1.To run both Server and Client issue the following command from within the
      InstallationInstructions directory:

       ./run.sh

      This will run Server in the background and then Client as the foreground
      process.
    
    2. To run just Server or just Client there are scripts that can be run to
       start the Server first and then open another terminal to start the
       Client. This can be useful for troubleshooting.To run in this
       configuration just issue these commands from the InstallInstructions
       directory:

       ./runServer.sh

       ./runClient.sh
       
       3. To run directly from source code. Issue the following command froms within 
          the directory RentalPropertyManagementSystem/src
          
          java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar" Server 
          (Open a new terminal.)
          java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar" Client 



-----------Purpose
This program gives property managers the ability to manage a database of
rental properties and tenants through the use of a user friendly graphical
user interface. This application allows for simple manipulation of a database
by way of creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. If a tenant is
late on a payment action letters for each stage of tenant payment deliquency 
is automatically filled out with the information corresponding to that tenant. 
This action letter is saved to a file with the tenant's first name, last name,
and the property ID. This functionality makes for a fast and simple way to 
notify tenants that are past due on their rent payments. 


---------Other Notes
Please note: when creating the Property ID, the ID must be created in this way:
The first character is either A, S, or V. This will indicate whether the property
is an apartment, single family home, or vacation home rental (respectively).
The second character is the number of bedrooms. 1 will be 1 bedroom, 2 will be 2,
and 3 will be 3.
The rest of the characters can be whatever identification method that your company
would like to implement.
