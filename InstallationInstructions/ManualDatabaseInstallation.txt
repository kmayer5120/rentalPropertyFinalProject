Manual Database Installation Procedures

The rental database management system uses Sqlite as it's database platform.
The software that has been shipped as your product should come with the
necessary driver to run this program with Sqlite, but in the event that
the software needs to be maintained, here are the steps to set up the 
drivers for the system.

Step 1:
    - Go to the Sqlite website and download the driver
        - Link: https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads/
        - Select version 3.21.0 (sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar)
        - Click link that corresponds with this version number.
        - Download
Step 2:
    - Move sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar to the directory where the java source code
      is located.
Step 3:
    - After moving the .jar file to the location of the source code.
      Issue the command java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.jar" Server
    - If the Sqlite driver is in the proper folder with Java source code,
      then there will be no errors when invoking the Server application.

Troubleshooting:
    - As stated above: The Sqlite driver must be located in the same folder as
      all of the Java source code. The code is written in a way such that the
      application will expect for the driver to be in the same directory.
      This is done for the purpose of simplificity.
    - If the when invoking the Server application errors are thrown, be sure to
      check that version 3.21.0 was the version that was downloaded.
    - If these two troubleshooting procedures fail please contact our service
      help desk at either 1-800-NOT-WORK or email helpService@itJustWorks.com
