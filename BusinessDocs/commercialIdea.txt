Okay, 1 min commercial idea for our project:
Camera pans from floor up to bed. Two men in the bed, their torsos and heads above the blanket
Guy 1: You know, something's been... different lately. Sometimes it just seems like you're not the woman I married....
Guy 2 (Looks at hands confused): ...You're right. I think I'm... somebody else...
Guy 1 (Picks up cat): And all this time I thought our son was acting so weird because he was going through puberty...
Voice Over: Never lose track of your tenants. Buy [Software name] today and ensure that everything is right where it should be.
