Dear %s %s,

Subject: Termination of Lease

Your rent is 3 weeks past due. The amount due was $.2f.
Because the payment is late, a late fee of $.2f has been added.
As no attempt to pay was made since our last message one week ago,
we will be terminating your rental agreement. 
You must move out within one week.

Regards,

iRental Solutions Inc.
