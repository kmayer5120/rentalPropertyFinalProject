Subject: Second notification of late payment

Your rent was due on (int date). The amount due was $(float rentDue).
Because the payment is late,a late fee of $(float lateFee) has been added.
As no attempt to pay was made by (int lateDate), if the payment is not received
by (int secondLateDate), then your lease agreement will be terminated.

making the total amount due (float latePaymentDue).

Thank you,

(String companyName)
