Dear %s %s,

Subject: Final Notice of Rent Past Due

Your rent is far past due. The amount due was $.2f
Because the payment is late,a late fee of $.2f has been added.
As no attempt to pay was made since our last letter, if the payment is 
not in 7 days, then your lease agreement will be terminated.

making the total amount due $.2f.

Thank you,
